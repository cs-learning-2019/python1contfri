For homework answer the following questions. These questions are a bit harder than usual.
I want to give you guys a small challenge.

Question 1
Write a function that takes a single integer as input. The function will draw circles
with random color and location to the screen with size 50. The number of circles to draw
is exactly the integer that is passed into the function. For example, if you pass the
function 5 then there should be 5 circles drawn. Hint: you will need to generate random
numbers and this will help https://processing.org/reference/random_.html

def draw_the_circles(num_of_circles):
    // Blah
    // Blah


Question 2
Write a function that print out the first n Fibonacci Numbers. This website my help you

Can you do it without using loops?
Ex) fib(2) --> 0, 1
    fib(6) --> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5

def fib(n):
  // Blah
  // Blah
